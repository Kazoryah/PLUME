# Removing Geometric Bias in One-Class Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Feature Perturbation

Official code of the article published in WACV 2025.

**PLUME** is an anomaly detection architecture based on abstract data representation.
It provides state-of-the-art results in the One-Class-Classification setting, on standard benchmarks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and on application specific datasets ([SPARK 2021](https://cvi2.uni.lu/spark-2021/)).
